I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse live websites. I can't provide a comparative analysis based on the data from yesterday and today. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 20 October 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 20 October 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>ðŸ”» No title or meta description found</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FE Jobs</td>
<td>ðŸ”» No title or meta description found</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>ðŸ”º Title and meta description found</td>
<td>Good SEO practices</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows based on your analysis of the data. Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual findings.
