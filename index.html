I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I can't provide you with the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document you need to create based on the data you provided:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eTeach</td>
        <td>Accessible but no title or description</td>
        <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FE Jobs</td>
        <td>Accessible but no title or description</td>
        <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Reed</td>
        <td>Accessible with title and description</td>
        <td>Good SEO practices</td>
        <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add the rest of the rows here -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
