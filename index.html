I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet or fetch additional data. I can't provide the information you're asking for. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report - 08 November 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.eteach.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.fejobs.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the rest of the rows based on your data.
