I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases, so I can't provide the real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries for each job board collected today. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML report based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 05 October 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 05 October 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eteach.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fejobs.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>Title and meta description found</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows with the data you have. If you have any changes or trends to report, you can add them in the "Notes" column. If you find any new job boards, you can add them as new rows and mark them with an asterisk (*) in the "Platform" column.
