I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to track changes from the previous day. However, I can create a template for the HTML table you requested, based on the information you provided. 

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 28 July 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
            <th>Strategy Summary</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eteach.com</td>
            <td>No title and description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>No title and description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>

            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>jobs.ac.uk</td>
            <td>Accessible with title and description</td>
            <td>Good SEO practices</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>teachingpersonnel.com</td>
            <td>Website inaccessible</td>
            <td>Website needs to be fixed</td>
            <td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" columns are filled with placeholder text, as I don't have the ability to track real-time changes or analyze SEO strategies. You would need to fill in this information based on your own analysis.
