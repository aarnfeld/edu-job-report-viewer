I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases, so I can't provide real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries or compare them with yesterday's data. However, I can help you create a template for an HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 31 August 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>

<tr>

<td>No title or description found</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>

<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
