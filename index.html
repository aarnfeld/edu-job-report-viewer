I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to monitor changes in websites over time. Therefore, I can't provide the analysis you're asking for. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you've given me. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 22 October 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td>No changes observed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td>No changes observed</td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" sections based on your analysis of the data.
