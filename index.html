I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse live websites or fetch additional data. I can't provide the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday or any other day. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eteach.com</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fejobs.com</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>teachingpersonnel.com</td>
<td>Website not accessible</td>
<td>403 error</td>
<td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" columns based on your analysis of the changes and trends for each site.
