As an AI, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access real-time data, so I can't provide the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday or discover new UK education job boards. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 23 September 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
            <th>Strategy Summary</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eTeach</td>
            <td>No title or description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FE Jobs</td>
            <td>No title or description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
            <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reed</td>
            <td>Title and description present</td>
            <td>Good SEO practices</td>
            <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. If there were any changes compared to yesterday, you can use the ðŸ”º or ðŸ”» symbols in the "Feature/SEO Change" column to indicate this.
