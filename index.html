I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to browse live websites or fetch additional data. Therefore, I can't provide a comparative analysis based on real-time data. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided:

<body>
    <h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 28 August 2025</h1>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Platform</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
        </tbody>
    </table>
