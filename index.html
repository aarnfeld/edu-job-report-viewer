I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to fetch real-time data. I can't provide a comparison with yesterday's data or discover new UK education job boards. However, I can help you create an HTML table based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Platform</th>
                <th>Status</th>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Meta Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>www.eteach.com</td>
                <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
                <td>No title found</td>
                <td>No description</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>www.fejobs.com</td>
                <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
                <td>No title found</td>
                <td>No description</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>www.reed.co.uk</td>
                <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
                <td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
                <td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add other rows similarly -->
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can add the remaining rows in a similar fashion. Also, please note that the actual analysis of changes, trends, SEO-significant wording or tone, and emerging trends would require access to the previous day's data, which I don't have.
