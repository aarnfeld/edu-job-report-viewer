I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to internet data or the ability to browse websites. Therefore, I can't provide you with the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday or any other day. I can only generate responses based on the information provided to me in the prompt. 

However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document you need to create based on the data you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FE Jobs</td>
<td>No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
<td>Good SEO practices</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
