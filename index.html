I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I can't provide you with real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries or compare them with the previous day's data. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document you need based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - Wednesday 17 September 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>No title or meta description</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>No title or meta description</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>Title and meta description present</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. If you need more help with this, feel free to ask!
