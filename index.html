I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to fetch real-time data, compare it with data from the previous day, or browse live websites. However, I can assist you in creating a template for your HTML document based on the information you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 28th September 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 28th September 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eteach.com</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fejobs.com</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can replace the placeholders with the actual data. For example, if the title or meta description of a website has changed since yesterday, you can note that in the "Feature/SEO Change" column. If a website has become inaccessible, you can note that in the "Notes" column. If you discover a new job board, you can mark it with an asterisk (*) in the "Platform" column and note "* added by GPT" in the "Notes" column.
