I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from the previous day. I can only provide information based on the data you've given me. However, I can help you create a template for an HTML document based on the data you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 13 June 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
            <th>Strategy Summary</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eTeach</td>
            <td>No title or description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FE Jobs</td>
            <td>No title or description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
            <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reed</td>
            <td>Title and description present</td>
            <td>Good SEO practices</td>
            <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows with the data you have, and add any notes or changes you've observed.
