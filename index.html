As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases, so I can't provide real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries or compare today's data with the previous working day. However, I can guide you on how to analyze the data you have and how to present it.

1. Report specific changes and trends for each site:

   Based on the data provided, you can note the accessibility status of each site, whether they have a title and meta description, and any changes in these aspects. For example, if a site was previously inaccessible but is now accessible, that would be a significant change. If a site previously had a title and meta description but now doesn't, that would also be noteworthy.

2. Identify and include any new UK education job boards you discover:

   As I can't browse the internet, I can't discover new job boards. However, if you come across any new ones, you can add them to your list and mark them with an asterisk.

3. Compare today's data with the previous working day:

   To do this, you would need data from the previous working day. You could then compare the accessibility status, title, and meta description of each site on the two days.

4. Include relevant supporting URLs for all findings:

   The URLs for each site are already included in the data you have. If you find any new job boards, you would need to include their URLs as well.

5. Present a full comparative table from all websites provided and those you have found:

   You could create a table with columns for the website URL, accessibility status, title, and meta description, and rows for each job board. You could then fill in the information for each job board based on the data you have.

6. Output only the HTML body starting with <html> and ending with </html>:

   As an AI, I can't fetch live HTML data from websites. However, if you have access to the HTML of the websites, you can extract the part of the code that starts with <html> and ends with </html>. This would typically include all the content of the webpage, excluding the doctype declaration.
