I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to the web or the ability to track changes from previous days. However, I can provide you with a template for how you might structure your HTML document based on the information you've given.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Platform</th>
                <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
                <th>Strategy Summary</th>
                <th>Supporting URL</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>eTeach</td>
                <td>No title or meta description</td>
                <td>Website accessible, but lacks SEO content</td>
                <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FEJobs</td>
                <td>No title or meta description</td>
                <td>Website accessible, but lacks SEO content</td>
                <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Reed</td>
                <td>Title and meta description present</td>
                <td>Website accessible and SEO optimized</td>
                <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jobs.ac.uk</td>
                <td>Title and meta description present</td>
                <td>Website accessible and SEO optimized</td>
                <td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Teaching Personnel</td>
                <td>Website inaccessible (403)</td>
                <td>Website currently inaccessible, metadata not retrievable</td>
                <td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Continue with the rest of the websites -->
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```

You would need to fill in the rest of the table with the remaining websites and any notes or changes you've observed.
