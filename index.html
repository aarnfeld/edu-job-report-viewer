I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it to data from a previous day. I can only generate text based on the information provided to me in the prompt and my training data. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you've given me. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 20 September 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 20 September 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Title</th>
<th>Meta Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eteach.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fejobs.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
<td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows for each site -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows for each site, and add additional columns if you want to track other information. You can also use CSS to style the table and make it easier to read.
