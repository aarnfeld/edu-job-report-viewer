I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I can't provide the information you're asking for. I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 30 May 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
            <th>Strategy Summary</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eTeach</td>
            <td>ðŸ”º Website Accessible</td>
            <td>No title or meta description found</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FEjobs</td>
            <td>ðŸ”º Website Accessible</td>
            <td>No title or meta description found</td>
            <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows for each platform -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows with the appropriate data. Please note that the arrows (ðŸ”º and ðŸ”») are placeholders and should be replaced based on the actual changes observed.
