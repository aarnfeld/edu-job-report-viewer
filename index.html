As an AI, I don't have real-time data access or browsing capabilities to carry out the tasks you've requested. However, I can guide you on how to perform the analysis based on the information you provided.

1. Report specific changes and trends for each site:

   You would need to compare the current status, title, and meta description of each website with the data from the previous day. Note any changes in accessibility, changes in the title or meta description, and any trends such as multiple sites becoming inaccessible.

2. Identify and include any new UK education job boards you discover:

   You would need to conduct an online search for new UK education job boards, then check their status, title, and meta description. Add these to your list and mark them with *.

3. Compare today's data with the previous working day:

   You would need to have data from Wednesday 28 May 2025 to compare with the current data. Look for changes in website status, title, and meta description.

4. Include relevant supporting URLs for all findings:

   You would need to provide the URLs of all websites you are analyzing, as well as any new websites you discover.

5. Present a full comparative table of all the websites:

   You could create a table with columns for website URL, status, title, and meta description, and rows for each website. Include data from both 28 and 29 May 2025 for comparison.

6. Output only the HTML body starting with <html> and ending with </html>:

   This would require viewing the source code of each website and copying the section between the <html> and </html> tags. However, this is typically a large amount of text and may not be useful for your analysis.

Remember, as an AI, I can't perform these tasks for you, but I hope this guide helps you in your analysis.
