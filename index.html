I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have real-time data or the ability to compare today's data with yesterday's. I can't provide specific changes or trends for each site compared with yesterday. However, I can help you create a HTML table based on the data you provided. Here is an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Title</th>
<th>Meta Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.eteach.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.fejobs.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
<td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>Jobs | Job Search | Job Vacancies on jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>Start your UK &amp; international job search for academic jobs, research jobs, science jobs and managerial jobs in leading universities and top global employers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.teachingpersonnel.com</td>
<td>Status: 403</td>
<td>Could not retrieve metadata.</td>
<td>Could not retrieve metadata.</td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as necessary -->
</table>

```

You can add more rows to this table as necessary. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
