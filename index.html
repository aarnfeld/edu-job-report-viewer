I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse live websites. I can't provide updates or changes compared to yesterday's data. However, I can help you create a template for a comparative HTML table based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eTeach</td>
        <td>No title, No description</td>
        <td>Website accessible but lacks SEO metadata</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FEJobs</td>
        <td>No title, No description</td>
        <td>Website accessible but lacks SEO metadata</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows for each website -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the table based on the data you have. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
