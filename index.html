I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse websites. I can't provide a comparison with the previous day's data or identify new job boards. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here it is:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 06 June 2025</title>

<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Meta Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eteach.com</td>
            <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
            <td>No title found</td>
            <td>No description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
            <td>No title found</td>
            <td>No description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>reed.co.uk</td>
            <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
            <td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
            <td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>jobs.ac.uk</td>
            <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
            <td>Jobs | Job Search | Job Vacancies on jobs.ac.uk</td>
            <td>Start your UK &amp; international job search for academic jobs, research jobs, science jobs and managerial jobs in leading universities and top global employers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>teachingpersonnel.com</td>
            <td>Status: 403</td>
            <td>Could not retrieve metadata.</td>
            <td>Could not retrieve metadata.</td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows to this table as needed, following the same format. This table includes columns for the platform (website), status, title, and meta description.
