I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to monitor changes in websites from day to day. I can help you create a template for the HTML document you need to create based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report - 21 October 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title or meta description</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>No title or meta description</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Title and meta description present</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>No title or meta description</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Teaching Personnel</td>
<td>Title and meta description present</td>
<td>Website accessible</td>
<td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the rows with the appropriate data. Remember to add more rows as needed for each website you're reporting on.
