I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. However, I can provide you with an example of how you could structure the HTML document based on the data you provided:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 30 September 2025</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eTeach</td>
        <td>No title and description</td>
        <td>Website is accessible, but lacks SEO significant wording</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FEJobs</td>
        <td>No title and description</td>
        <td>Website is accessible, but lacks SEO significant wording</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Reed</td>
        <td>Title and description present</td>
        <td>Website is accessible and has SEO significant wording</td>
        <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jobs.ac.uk</td>
        <td>No title and description</td>
        <td>Website is accessible, but lacks SEO significant wording</td>
        <td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Teaching Personnel</td>
        <td>Title and description present</td>
        <td>Website is accessible and has SEO significant wording</td>
        <td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Please replace the placeholders with the actual data. For example, if a website's accessibility status has changed since yesterday, you might mark that with a ðŸ”º or ðŸ”» in the "Notes" column and provide details in the "Feature/SEO Change" column.
