I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet. I can't provide you with the requested analysis based on real-time data or website checks. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML report based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 29 July 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
            <th>Strategy Summary</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eteach.com</td>
            <td>ðŸ”º Website Accessible</td>
            <td>No title or meta description</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>fejobs.com</td>
            <td>ðŸ”º Website Accessible</td>
            <td>No title or meta description</td>
            <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can replace the placeholder text in each table data tag `<td>` with the relevant information for each site. Add more rows as needed by copying and pasting the row tags `<tr>...</tr>`.
