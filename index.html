I'm sorry but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or browse live websites. I can only provide information based on the data provided to me. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 23 July 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 23 July 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>ðŸ”ºAccessible but no title or description</td>
<td>No SEO strategy visible</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FE Jobs</td>
<td>ðŸ”ºAccessible but no title or description</td>
<td>No SEO strategy visible</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>ðŸ”ºAccessible, title and description present</td>
<td>SEO strategy focuses on job availability and ease of use</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as necessary -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. For inaccessible websites, you can mark the Feature/SEO Change column with "ðŸ”»Inaccessible" and leave the Strategy Summary and Notes columns blank.
