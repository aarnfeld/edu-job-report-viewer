I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the web, so I can't provide the information you're asking for. However, I can create a template for you to fill in based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eTeach</td>
        <td>ðŸ”º Website accessible</td>
        <td>No title or meta description found</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FE Jobs</td>
        <td>ðŸ”º Website accessible</td>
        <td>No title or meta description found</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the rest of the rows with the information you have. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
