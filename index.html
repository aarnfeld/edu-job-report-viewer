I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to website data or the ability to browse the internet or fetch additional data. I can't provide a comparative analysis based on real-time data or identify new UK education job boards. However, I can help you create a template for an HTML document that you can fill in with the relevant data. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Boards Analysis - 02 July 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Boards Analysis - 02 July 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>ðŸ”º/ðŸ”»</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEjobs</td>
<td>ðŸ”º/ðŸ”»</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows for each platform -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can replace the ðŸ”º/ðŸ”» with the actual changes, fill in the Strategy Summary and Notes columns based on your analysis, and add more rows for each platform.
