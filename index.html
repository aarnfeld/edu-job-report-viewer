I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. I can only provide information based on the data you've provided in the prompt. However, I can help you create an HTML table based on the data you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Platform</th>
                <th>Status</th>
                <th>Title</th>
                <th>Meta Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>eteach.com</td>
                <td>Accessible</td>
                <td>No title found</td>
                <td>No description</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>fejobs.com</td>
                <td>Accessible</td>
                <td>No title found</td>
                <td>No description</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>reed.co.uk</td>
                <td>Accessible</td>
                <td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
                <td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows to the table by copying and pasting the `<tr>` element and updating the `<td>` elements with the relevant information.
