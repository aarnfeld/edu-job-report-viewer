I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to provide real-time data or compare it with the data from the previous day. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML table you need to fill out based on the data you have. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eteach.com</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>Update required for SEO</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fejobs.com</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>Update required for SEO</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Title and meta description found</td>
<td>No changes needed</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

Please replace the placeholder data with your real data. You can add more rows by copying and pasting the `<tr>` to `</tr>` section and replacing the data as needed.
