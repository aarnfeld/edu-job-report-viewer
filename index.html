I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. I can only generate text based on the information you provide to me. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document based on the data you've given me. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 24 October 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 24 October 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Accessible, Title and description present</td>
<td>Good SEO practice</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. If there are any changes compared to the previous day, you can use the ðŸ”º or ðŸ”» symbols in the "Notes" column. For any new platforms, you can add a "*" symbol in the "Platform" column and a note in the "Notes" column.
