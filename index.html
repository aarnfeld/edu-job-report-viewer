Sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with past data. I can only generate responses based on the information provided to me during the conversation. I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you've provided, but I can't fill in the changes or trends as I don't have access to yesterday's data. Here's a basic template:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 21 June 2025</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Platform</th>
                <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
                <th>Strategy Summary</th>
                <th>Supporting URL</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>eTeach</td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
                <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FEjobs</td>
                <td></td>
                <td></td>
                <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```

In the empty `<td></td>` tags, you can add the relevant information for each job board. For example, in the "Feature/SEO Change" column, you might note changes in website accessibility, page titles, or meta descriptions. In the "Strategy Summary" column, you might discuss SEO-significant wording or tone and emerging trends. The "Notes" column can be used for any additional observations or comments.
