I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access real-time data. I can't provide a comparative analysis of the websites for today, 23 June 2025, or any other future date. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document you need to create based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eteach.com</td>
        <td>ðŸ”» No title or meta description found</td>
        <td>Website needs to improve SEO by adding a title and meta description</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>fejobs.com</td>
        <td>ðŸ”» No title or meta description found</td>
        <td>Website needs to improve SEO by adding a title and meta description</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows for each platform -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the rows for each platform based on your analysis of the data you have.
