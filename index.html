I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. However, I can provide you with an example of how you might structure your HTML document based on the data you provided.

Please note that the "ðŸ”º" and "ðŸ”»" symbols are used to indicate changes based on the assumption that the previous day's data had complete metadata for all sites and all sites were accessible. You would need to adjust these based on the actual changes from the previous day.
