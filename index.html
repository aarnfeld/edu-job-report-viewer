I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases. Therefore, I can't provide you with the real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries for each job board collected today, or compare them with yesterday's data. I can, however, help you create a template for your HTML report based on the instructions you've given. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Report - 20 August 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Report - 20 August 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>ðŸ”º Website accessible</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FE Jobs</td>
<td>ðŸ”º Website accessible</td>
<td>No title or meta description found</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows for each job board -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows with the data you have. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
