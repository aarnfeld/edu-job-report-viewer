I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to fetch or compare data from different days. I can't provide you with specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday or any other day. However, I can help you create a template for a comparative HTML table based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eteach.com</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fejobs.com</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>Good SEO practices</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill this table with the appropriate data based on your analysis. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.
