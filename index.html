I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it to data from previous days. However, I can provide you with a template of how you can structure your HTML document based on the data you've provided. 

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eTeach</td>
        <td>ðŸ”º Website Accessible</td>
        <td>No title or meta description found</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FEJobs</td>
        <td>ðŸ”º Website Accessible</td>
        <td>No title or meta description found</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Reed</td>
        <td>ðŸ”º Website Accessible</td>
        <td>Title and Meta Description found</td>
        <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change" and "Strategy Summary" columns based on the changes you've observed from the previous day. The "Notes" column can be used to add any additional observations or insights.
