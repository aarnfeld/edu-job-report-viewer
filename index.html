I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet, which means I can't provide the information you're asking for. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the instructions you've given. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report - 19 October 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.eteach.com</td>
<td>ðŸ”º/ðŸ”»</td>
<td>Strategy summary goes here</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td>Notes go here</td>
</tr>
<!-- Repeat the above <tr> block for each platform -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can replace "ðŸ”º/ðŸ”»" with the actual change, "Strategy summary goes here" with your summary of the strategy, and "Notes go here" with any notes you have. Repeat the `<tr>` block for each platform.
