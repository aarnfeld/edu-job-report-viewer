I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases to fetch or compare the data for the websites mentioned. I can help you create a template for the HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 05 June 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 05 June 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows for each website -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" columns based on the changes you observe compared to the previous day. If you need help with how to analyze these changes, I'd be happy to assist!
