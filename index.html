I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with the data from yesterday. I can only generate text based on the information provided to me in the prompt. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document based on the data you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 30 August 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 30 August 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEjobs</td>
<td>No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Title and description found</td>
<td>Good SEO practices</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Teaching Personnel</td>
<td>Website inaccessible</td>
<td>Website needs to be accessible for SEO</td>
<td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

Please replace the placeholder text with the actual data. You can add more rows as needed by copying and pasting the `<tr>` and `</tr>` tags and everything in between.
