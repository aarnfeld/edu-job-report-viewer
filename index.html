I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases to provide the information you're asking for. I can't provide real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries or compare them with the previous day's data. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 25 August 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FE Jobs</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Accessible, Title and Description present</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Teaching Personnel</td>
<td>Status 403</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Continue for each site -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" columns based on your analysis of the data.
