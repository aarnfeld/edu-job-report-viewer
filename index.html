I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to browse live websites or fetch additional data. Therefore, I can't provide you with the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday, or any other real-time data. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document you need to create. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 04 August 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>ðŸ”º/ðŸ”»</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>ðŸ”º/ðŸ”»</td>
<td></td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" fields based on the data you have. Use ðŸ”º to indicate improvements or positive changes, and ðŸ”» to indicate declines or negative changes.
