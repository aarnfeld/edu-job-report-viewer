I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse websites. I can't compare the current data with the data from yesterday, as I don't have access to yesterday's data. However, I can help you create an HTML table based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Meta Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>www.eteach.com</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>No title found</td>
        <td>No description</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>www.fejobs.com</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>No title found</td>
        <td>No description</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>www.reed.co.uk</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
        <td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - ♥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows for each website -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Please replace the comment `<!-- Add more rows for each website -->` with the rest of the rows for the remaining websites.
