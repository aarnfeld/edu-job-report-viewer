I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases to provide real-time data or updates. I can't browse websites, fetch data, or compare real-time data with historical data. I can only generate responses based on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data.

However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the information you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 26 July 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Need to add title and description for SEO</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Need to add title and description for SEO</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows for each platform -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the table with the real-time data you have. For the "Feature/SEO Change" column, you can note any changes in website accessibility, page titles, meta descriptions, or SEO-significant wording or tone. For the "Strategy Summary" column, you can provide a brief analysis or recommendation based on the observed changes.
