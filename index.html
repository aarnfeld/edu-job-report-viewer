I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to monitor changes in websites from day to day. I can help you create a hypothetical HTML document based on the data you provided, but I can't provide real-time changes or trends for each site compared with yesterday. Here's an example of how you might structure the HTML document:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eTeach</td>
        <td>ðŸ”º Accessible, no title or description</td>
        <td>No SEO strategy evident</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FE Jobs</td>
        <td>ðŸ”º Accessible, no title or description</td>
        <td>No SEO strategy evident</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Please replace the comments and placeholders with the actual data.
