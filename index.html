I'm sorry, but I can't provide the information you're asking for. As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or browse the internet. I can't compare the current status of the websites with their status yesterday or identify new UK education job boards. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML table you're asking for based on the information you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eteach.com</td>
        <td>No title or description</td>
        <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>fejobs.com</td>
        <td>No title or description</td>
        <td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>reed.co.uk</td>
        <td>Title and description present</td>
        <td>Good SEO</td>
        <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the table with the appropriate information based on your findings.
