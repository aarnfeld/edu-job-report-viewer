I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare data from different days. I can only generate responses based on the information provided to me in the prompt. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the information you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 26 June 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Website Status</th>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Meta Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eteach.com</td>
            <td>Accessible</td>
            <td>No title found</td>
            <td>No description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>fejobs.com</td>
            <td>Accessible</td>
            <td>No title found</td>
            <td>No description</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>reed.co.uk</td>
            <td>Accessible</td>
            <td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
            <td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows to the table as needed, and adjust the column headers to fit the data you're presenting.
