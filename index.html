I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. However, I can provide you with a template for how you might structure your HTML document based on the data you've provided.

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 11 August 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
            <th>Strategy Summary</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eTeach</td>
            <td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
            <td>Need to add title and meta description for SEO</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FEjobs</td>
            <td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
            <td>Need to add title and meta description for SEO</td>
            <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Reed</td>
            <td>Accessible, Title and Meta Description found</td>
            <td>No changes needed</td>
            <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You would replace the placeholders in the table rows with the actual data for each site. For example, if a site's accessibility status changed from yesterday, you might indicate this in the "Feature/SEO Change" column with a ðŸ”º or ðŸ”» symbol. If you discovered a new job board, you could add a row for it and note this in the "Notes" column with "* added by GPT."
