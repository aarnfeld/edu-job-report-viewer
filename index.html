I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from the previous day. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML table based on the data you've provided.

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Website Accessibility</th>
            <th>Page Title</th>
            <th>Meta Description</th>
            <th>SEO-Significant Wording or Tone</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eTeach</td>
            <td>Accessible</td>
            <td>No title found</td>
            <td>No description</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FEJobs</td>
            <td>Accessible</td>
            <td>No title found</td>
            <td>No description</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
            <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows for each job board -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows with the data you have for each job board. If there are any changes from the previous day, you can use the "Notes" column to describe them. For example, if a site's accessibility status changed from "Inaccessible" to "Accessible", you could note this change in the "Notes" column.
