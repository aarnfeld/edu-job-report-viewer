I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to fetch and compare data from different days. I can only use the data provided in the prompt to generate a response. However, I can help you create a HTML table based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Title</th>
<th>Meta Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.eteach.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.fejobs.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
<td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as necessary -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows to the table as necessary, following the same format. For the 'Platform', 'Status', 'Title', and 'Meta Description' columns, just replace the placeholder text with the actual data for each site.
