I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any external databases, so I can't provide real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries or compare them with the data from yesterday. I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
            <th>Strategy Summary</th>
            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eTeach</td>
            <td>No title, No description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
            <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>FEjobs</td>
            <td>No title, No description</td>
            <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
            <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```
You can fill in the table with the relevant data for each website. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
