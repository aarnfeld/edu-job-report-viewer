I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to track changes over time. I can't provide you with the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document based on the data you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>Good SEO practices</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```
You can fill in the table with the appropriate data for each website. For the "Feature/SEO Change" column, you would note any changes in the website's title, meta description, or other SEO features. The "Strategy Summary" column would contain a brief summary of the website's SEO strategy based on the data you've collected. The "Supporting URL" column would contain the URL of the website, and the "Notes" column would contain any additional notes or observations.
