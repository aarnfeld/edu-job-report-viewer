I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet. I can't provide the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday or any other date. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML report based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report - 18 July 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>No title or meta description</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>No title or meta description</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>Title and meta description present</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as necessary -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the table with the appropriate data for each website. If a website's status has changed since the last report, you might use the ðŸ”º or ðŸ”» symbols in the "Feature/SEO Change" column to indicate this.
