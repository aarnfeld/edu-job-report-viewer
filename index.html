I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's how you can structure it:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 06 October 2025</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Platform</th>
                <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
                <th>Strategy Summary</th>
                <th>Supporting URL</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>eTeach</td>
                <td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
                <td></td>
                <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FE Jobs</td>
                <td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
                <td></td>
                <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Reed</td>
                <td>Accessible, Title and Description available</td>
                <td></td>
                <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" columns based on your analysis of the changes and trends for each site.
