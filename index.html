I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to compare the current data with the data from yesterday as I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to remember past data. However, I can help you create a HTML table based on the data you provided. Here's how you can structure it:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 10 August 2025</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Meta Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eteach.com</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>No title found</td>
        <td>No description</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>fejobs.com</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>No title found</td>
        <td>No description</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>reed.co.uk</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
        <td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>jobs.ac.uk</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>No title found</td>
        <td>No description</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>teachingpersonnel.com</td>
        <td>403</td>
        <td>Could not retrieve metadata</td>
        <td>Could not retrieve metadata</td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows to the table as needed, following the structure of the existing rows.
