I'm sorry, but as an AI model, I don't have the capability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML report based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 14 June 2025</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Platform</th>
                <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
                <th>Strategy Summary</th>
                <th>Supporting URL</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>eTeach</td>
                <td>Website accessible, No title, No description</td>
                <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
                <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FEJobs</td>
                <td>Website accessible, No title, No description</td>
                <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
                <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Reed</td>
                <td>Website accessible, Title and description present</td>
                <td>Good SEO practices</td>
                <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. Remember to replace the placeholders in the 'Notes' column with any relevant information you have.
