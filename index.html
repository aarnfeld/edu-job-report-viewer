I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time data access and can't provide the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday. However, I can help you create an HTML table structure based on the data you provided:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eteach.com</td>
        <td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
        <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>fejobs.com</td>
        <td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
        <td>Needs SEO improvements</td>
        <td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>reed.co.uk</td>
        <td>Accessible, Title and description present</td>
        <td>Good SEO practices</td>
        <td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>jobs.ac.uk</td>
        <td>Accessible, Title and description present</td>
        <td>Good SEO practices</td>
        <td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. The "Feature/SEO Change" column should contain information about the website's accessibility, title, and meta description. The "Strategy Summary" column should contain a brief analysis of the website's SEO strategy based on the provided data. The "Supporting URL" column should contain the URL of the website. The "Notes" column can contain any additional information or observations.
