I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access real-time data. Therefore, I can't provide the changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday or any other day. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here is an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 25 October 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>Good SEO practices</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the rest of the rows based on the data you have. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.
