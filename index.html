I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to compare it with data from yesterday. I can only generate responses based on the information provided to me. Therefore, I can't complete this task as requested. However, I can provide a template for how you might structure your HTML document based on the information you've given me.

This is a basic template and you would need to fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" columns based on your analysis of the changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday.
