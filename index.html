I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse websites. I can't provide the information you're asking for. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the information you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 20 June 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 20 June 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>No changes observed</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FE Jobs</td>
<td>Accessible, No title, No description</td>
<td>No changes observed</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as necessary -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the rest of the rows with the data you have, and add any new job boards you discover. Use ðŸ”º or ðŸ”» in the "Feature/SEO Change" column to mark notable movements.
