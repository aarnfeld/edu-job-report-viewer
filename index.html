I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or the ability to fetch or compare data from previous days. I can't provide specific changes or trends for each site compared with yesterday or any other day. However, I can help you to create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Market Intelligence Report - 30 May 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>No title, no description</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>No title, no description</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>Accessible</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Teaching Personnel</td>
<td>403 Error</td>
<td>Could not retrieve metadata</td>
<td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can fill in the "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", and "Notes" columns based on your analysis of the data.
