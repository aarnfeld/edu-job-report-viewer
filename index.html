I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML report based on the information you provided. Here's an example:

<!-- Add the rest of the sites in the same format -->

You can fill in the rest of the rows in the same format. For the columns "Feature/SEO Change", "Strategy Summary", "Supporting URL", and "Notes", you would need to analyze the data yourself and fill in the information as appropriate.
