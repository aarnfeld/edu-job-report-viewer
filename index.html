I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or compare it with data from previous days. I can't browse the internet or access databases, so I can't provide the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML document based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 12 November 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO optimization</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO optimization</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>SEO optimized</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jobs.ac.uk</td>
<td>No title or description</td>
<td>Needs SEO optimization</td>
<td>https://www.jobs.ac.uk/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Teaching Personnel</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>SEO optimized</td>
<td>https://www.teachingpersonnel.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a basic HTML document with a table that includes the columns you specified. You can add more rows to the table as needed.
