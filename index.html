I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time data access or the ability to browse live websites. I can't provide a comparison with yesterday's data, or identify new job boards, as I don't have access to the internet or any external databases. However, I can help you create an HTML table based on the data you provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Title</th>
<th>Meta Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eteach.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fejobs.com</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>No title found</td>
<td>No description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>reed.co.uk</td>
<td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
<td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
<td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - â™¥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as necessary -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows to the table by copying and pasting the `<tr>` element and replacing the text inside the `<td>` elements with the relevant data.
