I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to provide real-time data or compare it with past data. I can only generate information based on the data you provide. However, I can help you create an HTML table based on the data you've given me. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Meta Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eteach.com</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>No title found</td>
        <td>No description</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>fejobs.com</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>No title found</td>
        <td>No description</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>reed.co.uk</td>
        <td>Accessible (200 OK)</td>
        <td>Jobs and Recruitment on Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site</td>
        <td>Find your next job from the 200,000 available, hire staff, or start a new course today - ♥ Mondays with Reed.co.uk, the UK's #1 job site.</td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add the rest of the rows here -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can add more rows to the table by copying and pasting the `<tr>` element and replacing the content of the `<td>` elements.
