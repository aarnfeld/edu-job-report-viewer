I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I can't provide the changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday, or discover new UK education job boards. However, I can help you create a template for the HTML document based on the data you provided.

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>

<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>

            <th>Supporting URL</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>eTeach</td>
