I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to access real-time data or browse the internet. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the requested analysis based on real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries for each job board collected today. However, I can help you create a template for your HTML report based on the data you've provided. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 29 September 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 29 September 2025</h1>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FE Jobs</td>
<td>No title, No description</td>
<td>Needs SEO improvement</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reed</td>
<td>Title and description present</td>
<td>Good SEO practice</td>
<td>https://www.reed.co.uk</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can replace the placeholder data in this template with your real data. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
