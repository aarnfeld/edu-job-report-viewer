I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I can't provide you with real-time website accessibility and metadata summaries for each job board collected today, 27 June 2025. However, I can provide you with a template of how you could structure your HTML document based on the data you have:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 27 June 2025</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>UK Education Job Board Analysis - 27 June 2025</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
<th>Strategy Summary</th>
<th>Supporting URL</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eTeach</td>
<td>ðŸ”º Website accessible, no title, no description</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FEJobs</td>
<td>ðŸ”º Website accessible, no title, no description</td>
<td>...</td>
<td>https://www.fejobs.com/</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

You can replace the ellipses (...) with the relevant information based on the data you have. You can also add more rows as needed by copying and pasting the `<tr>...</tr>` block and updating the information.
