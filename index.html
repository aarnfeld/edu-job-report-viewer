I'm sorry, but as an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet. Therefore, I can't provide the specific changes and trends for each site compared with yesterday or any other day. I can only generate responses based on the information provided to me in the prompt. 

However, I can help you create a template for the HTML table you need to fill out based on the data you have. Here's an example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>UK Education Job Board Analysis</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Platform</th>
        <th>Feature/SEO Change</th>
        <th>Strategy Summary</th>
        <th>Supporting URL</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>www.eteach.com</td>
        <td>No title or description found</td>
        <td>Website is accessible</td>
        <td>https://www.eteach.com/</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows for each platform -->
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can copy this template and fill in the details for each platform based on the data you have.
