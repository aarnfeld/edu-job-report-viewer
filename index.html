I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to data or the ability to browse the internet or compare data from different days. I can only provide information and analysis based on the data you provide me. 

However, I can guide you on how to create an HTML document based on the information you provided:

Please note that you would need to manually add any changes or trends compared to the previous day, as I don't have the ability to access or compare data from different days.
